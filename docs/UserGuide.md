### How your Internship Application Data is Organised in TinS
![data organisation](images/ug/ug-internship-organisation.png)

**Internships**
In TinS, an internship application is stored as an **Internship**. Within an Internship, you would be able to store the
following fields:
* `POSITION`: The Name of Internship Position.
* `COMPANY` : The Name of Hiring Company.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:information_source: **Info:** Each Internship is **uniquely identifiable** by a **combination of its `POSITION` and
`COMPANY`**. `POSITION` and `COMPANY` fields are **case-insensitive**. 

Example: The following internships will be identified as same internship in TinS.
* Internship with `POSITION` as `Software Engineer` and `COMPANY` as `Grab`
* Internship with `POSITION` as `Software ENGINEER` and `COMPANY` as `GRAB`

</div>

* `STATUS` : The Status of your Application. This is an **Integer value** from **0 to 3**. Here are the statuses for the
  corresponding integer values:
   * `0` : Interested
   * `1` : Applied
   * `2` : Offered
   * `3` : Rejected

* `DESCRIPTION` : Additional details about the Internship (E.g. Contact Details of Hiring Manager, Link to Internship
  Webpage, Requirements of Internship). This field can be left blank if you have nothing to include for this field.

* `TAG` : Customised Tag (E.g. `IMPORTANT`, `PRIORITY`). An Internship can have zero or more than one tag. All Tags in
  TinS are written in capitalised letters.

An Internship can also store zero or more than one **Event**. 

**Events**
In TinS, an **Event** can be used to represent a **Deadline** or an **Interview** associated to an Internship. Within
an Event, you would be able to store the following fields:
* `EVENT_NAME`: The Name of the Event.
* `START_DATETIME`: The Starting Time of an Event (in the format: DD/MM/YYYY HHMM).
* `END_DATETIME`: The Ending Time of an Event (in the format: DD/MM/YYYY HHMM).
  * If the Event is a **Deadline**, the `START_DATETIME` will be the same as the `END_DATETIME`.
* `EVENT_DESCRIPTION`: Description of the Event (e.g. Venue, Things to take note of). This field can be left blank if you have
  nothing to include for this field.

### Information about Crafting Your Command
This section contains information on how to craft your command.

#### Prefixes and Fields
TinS differentiates between the various fields in your command by its preceding prefix. The Prefixes are designed to be
short, to enable you to quickly indicate which field your information is associated to. Here is the list of fields and
their associated prefixes.

<table>

<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Prefix</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>POSITION</code></td>
<td><code>p/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>COMPANY</code></td>
<td><code>c/</code></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>STATUS</code></td>
<td><code>s/</code></td>

</table>

**Important Information for Use of Prefixes**
*

#### Notes about the Command Format
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add p/POSITION c/COMPANY_NAME s/APPLICATION_STATUS d/DESCRIPTION`, `POSITION` is a parameter which can be
  used as `add p/Software Engineer c/Grab s/1 d/Requires knowledge of Python and Java`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `[t/TAG]` means that the user input is optional.
