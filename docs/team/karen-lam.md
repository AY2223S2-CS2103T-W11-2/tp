### Project: The Intern's Ship

**The Intern's Ship (TinS)** is a desktop application for **internship-seeking university students** to more efficiently
and conveniently manage, coordinate and keep track of their numerous internship applications. Despite being optimised
for use via Command Line Interface (CLI), TinS also provides its user with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enable
its users to navigate the application with ease.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `list` Feature - Added the ability to view all internships.
    * What it does: allows the user to view all internships saved in TinS. Only internship position, company and
      associated tags are displayed in the List Panel.
    * Justification: This feature is vital for users to efficiently use TinS as it displays only essential information
      of all internship a user has, avoiding screen clutter.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands.

* **New Feature**: `clash` Feature
    * What it does: finds all Events with clashes in timings
